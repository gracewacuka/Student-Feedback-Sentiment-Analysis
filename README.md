🧠 <h3><b><u>Project Overview</u></b><h3>

This project analyzes student course feedback using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand how students feel about their courses and instructors beyond numeric survey ratings. By applying sentiment analysis to open-ended comments, the project uncovers emotional tone, common themes and relationships between sentiment, performance metrics and survey scores.

🎯 Objectives

Classify student feedback as positive, neutral, or negative

Identify common themes in student comments

Compare sentiment results with numeric survey ratings

Generate insights to improve teaching quality and student satisfaction

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas – data cleaning and analysis

TextBlob – sentiment analysis

Matplotlib and Seaborn – data visualization

WordCloud – text frequency visualization

Google Colab – development environment

📈 Key Insights

The average survey rating was approximately 2.99 out of 5, indicating moderate overall satisfaction.

Sentiment analysis revealed a mix of positive, neutral and negative feedback, suggesting varied student experiences.

Positive comments frequently included words like helpful, interesting and organized, highlighting the value of clear and engaging instruction.

Negative feedback often mentioned late, confusing and unclear, pointing to issues with communication, feedback timing and course structure.

Courses with higher student participation (attendance, assignments, LMS activity) generally received higher ratings and more positive sentiment, showing a correlation between engagement and satisfaction.

💡 Recommendations

Improve clarity and organization: Structured lessons, clear explanations, and accessible materials increase student satisfaction.

Encourage interactive learning: Discussions, group work, and real-world examples were strongly associated with positive feedback.

Enhance communication and consistency: Address delays, unclear instructions, and feedback timing to reduce negative sentiment.

Share best teaching practices: Instructors with consistently positive feedback can serve as models across departments.

Translating qualitative feedback into actionable insights



This analysis shows that while students are generally satisfied, targeted improvements in communication, engagement and course structure can significantly enhance the learning experience. Sentiment analysis complements numeric ratings by revealing the why behind student satisfaction scores, enabling more informed academic decisions.
